# NovaForge

Welcome to NovaForge, where vision meets execution. We are not just a digital agency — we're a team on a mission to reshape the future of websites and online presence for businesses around the world.

## **What is NovaForge?**

NovaForge is a modern digital agency focused on delivering high-converting, beautifully animated, and mobile-optimized websites with a clean dark aesthetic. We help businesses scale their online presence through custom website development, automation, and efficient outreach strategies.

We believe the web is still an underutilized weapon for many businesses — and NovaForge is here to change that.

**This isn’t a typical web agency. Here’s what we’ve been doing differently:**

- Custom internal systems to manage lead generation, client databases, and workflows
- Multiple recruitment campaigns and a trained team of cold outreach reps
- A sharp focus on high-performance websites — not just design templates


## Our Core Strengths

- **Websites that actually convert** — not just look good
- **Full-stack development** for landing pages, portfolios, eCommerce & SaaS
- **Scalable outreach and lead generation strategies**
- **Affordable pricing**: one-time fees and/or MRR (monthly payment)
- **Built-in systems** for client acquisition, branding & outreach

## **Timeline & Evolution**
- NovaForge was founded in 2025 by Roni Agushi, an entrepreneur with a vision to build multiple companies
from scratch and scale to 7 figures in one year. The agency quickly turned from a solo hustle into a powerful
team.

- Q1 2025: Initial solo development & outreach
- Q2 2025: Met Abedin Sokoli, who became Co-Founder and helped build outreach & lead systems
- Shortly after, Uron Ternava joined as a key operator — contributing to client operations, back-end
organization, and day-to-day strategy
- Mid 2025: Team growth, upgraded offer, and brand refinement

## **The Team**
- Roni Agushi – Founder & Visionary
- Abedin Sokoli – Co-Founder, Leader of Production
- Uron Ternava – Frontend & Production Operator

We’re aggressive and focused. We don't just sell websites — we build business machines.

If you're reading this and you're:
- **A business owner looking for a new website that converts**
- **An investor looking to back high-speed digital growth**
- **A talent wanting to work with a fast-moving, modern team**

## Getting Started

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
